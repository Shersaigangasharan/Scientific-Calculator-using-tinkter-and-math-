# Scientific-Calculator-using-tinkter-and-math
This project is a simple scientific calculator which aims to have a variety of scientific functions such as sin, cos, tan, exponential, log, etc. inspired by the built-in calculator on our Windows system as a reference for inspiration. The design and functionality of the calculator simple and  concise coded in python using tkinter and math libraries.

## The Scientific Calculator :
*	with various following functions to evaluate:
